# Engineer Mindset

How to think and work like a software engineer?

---

## Get out of your comfort zone

Experiment, and learn new things every day

## Embrace failure

An experienced engineer has failed more times than a beginner has tried.

## Change your perspective

From: I have to learn new things

To: I **get** to learn new things

### Breaking Down a Problem Into Smaller Parts

Breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts is a critical problem-solving technique used across many disciplines. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of each component, making the problem less overwhelming. By addressing each part individually, you can create a clear path toward a solution. This method is especially useful in software development, engineering, and complex project management, where tackling smaller tasks often leads to more efficient and effective solutions.

### Stepping Back / Step away

Stepping back or stepping away from a problem can be an effective strategy for gaining clarity. Giving yourself time to think allows your brain to process the information subconsciously, often leading to new insights or solutions. This practice can reduce mental fatigue and help you return to the problem with a fresh perspective, making it easier to approach challenges creatively and more effectively.

### The Importance of Learning One New Thing at a Time

Learning one new thing at a time, while connecting it to what you already know, is a key strategy to avoid being overwhelmed. This approach allows you to build on your existing knowledge, deepening your understanding without overloading your mind with too many new concepts at once. By focusing on incremental learning, you ensure better retention and application of new skills, leading to more sustainable progress over time.

### Impostor Syndrome

To overcome impostor syndrome, remind yourself that everyone knows things others don't. You have unique skills and knowledge that others may not possess. Also, while you are aware of what you don't know, others often aren't, and that doesn't diminish your competence. Focus on continuous learning and recognize that feeling uncertain at times is a normal part of growth.

### Embracing what you don't know

This is a chance to learn these things

## The T-Shaped Engineer

A T-shaped engineer has deep expertise in one area (the vertical part of the "T") and broad skills across multiple areas (the horizontal part). This allows them to specialize while also collaborating effectively with others. Their combination of depth and breadth makes them adaptable, versatile, and valuable in multidisciplinary teams.

### Using WSL for Windows

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows without the need for a virtual machine. It's lightweight and integrates seamlessly with Windows, making it a great option for developers who need Linux tools while still working in a Windows environment. WSL 2 brings improved performance with full Linux kernel support.

### Using Vagrant with VirtualBox

Vagrant, together with VirtualBox, enables the creation and management of lightweight, reproducible virtual environments. It's a powerful tool for developers who need to standardize development environments across teams. Vagrant's configuration files make it easy to automate the setup of multiple virtual machines with consistent settings.

### Native Linux / macOS Development

Developing directly on Linux or macOS provides a native Unix-based environment, which is ideal for most software development workflows. With native tools and no need for virtual machines, it offers great performance and is typically favored for server-side development, containerization, and tools like Docker and Kubernetes.

### Knowing Your Environment

Understanding the operating system and how computers work is foundational for effective software development. Knowing how processes are managed, how memory is allocated, and how filesystems operate allows you to troubleshoot issues and optimize performance. Whether you're working on Linux, macOS, or Windows, familiarity with basic system commands, process management tools, and how the OS interacts with hardware can significantly improve your ability to write efficient and reliable code.
