## 3. Evals Remain the Hardest and Most Indispensable


___

- The Evals track underscored critical challenges
  - **Eval is universally recognized as mission-critical**
  - Manual creation remains a bottleneck
  - Building automated, semantic/trajectory-based eval pipelines is still next-gen work

___

- Production implementations emerging
  - Teams like Braintrust and Zapier using **AI-driven scorers**
  - Deploying both explicit and implicit feedback pipelines
  - Better assessment of performance in production

___

- **Engineering reasoning**
  - "Evals" as a named core track
  - Echoed in recaps (e.g. "Eval is all you need")
  - Fundamental challenge waiting for robust tooling and standards

## 4. Specs-as-Code: Specifications Are The New Code

___

- Adoption of **Specificationâ€‘Driven Development**
  - Especially around *ModelSpecs*
  - Specs written in markdown (e.g., rules.md) become executable contracts
  - More durable than ephemeral prompts

___

- Sean Grove's presentation emphasized key benefits
  - Structured specs embed intent and requirements
  - Includes verifiable tests
  - Stronger foundation for LLM reliability and reproducibility

___

- **Why included**
  - Not covered in the original 7-market learnings
  - Major highlight in the SWEâ€‘Agents/SPEC track
  - Transformative for long-term maintainability

  - **Riskâ€‘aware, securityâ€‘byâ€‘design pipelines** for large-scale autonomous models
  - Covers design-time threat modeling
  - Runtime anomaly detection
  - Hardened training approaches

___

- Case studies validate importance
  - National-security applications
  - Industrial deployments
  - Need for "provable behavior guarantees" in live AI systems
