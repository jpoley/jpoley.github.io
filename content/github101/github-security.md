## Security: Find Issues Early, Block Risky Changes

### 🎯 **The Goal**
- **Catch problems** before they reach production
- **Automated detection** of security issues
- **Policy enforcement** to prevent bad changes
- **Continuous monitoring** of your codebase

### 🚫 **What We Block**
- **Vulnerable code** with known security issues
- **Secrets and credentials** accidentally committed
- **Outdated dependencies** with security holes
- **License violations** that create legal risk

---

## The Three Pillars of GHAS

### 🔍 **1. Code Scanning (CodeQL)**
- **Automated analysis** of your source code
- **Vulnerability detection** using pattern matching
- **Integration** with security databases (CVEs)
- **PR blocking** when critical issues found

### 🔐 **2. Secret Scanning + Push Protection**
- **Detects credentials** before they're committed
- **Blocks pushes** with suspicious content
- **Policy override** with justification
- **Automatic rotation** recommendations

### 📦 **3. Dependency Management**
- **Dependabot alerts** for known vulnerabilities
- **Automated updates** to secure versions
- **Supply chain** security monitoring
- **License compliance** checking

---

## Code Scanning: How It Works

### 🔍 **The Process**
1. **Code is written** and committed
2. **Automated analysis** runs on every change
3. **Security patterns** are identified
4. **Issues are reported** with severity levels
5. **PRs are blocked** if critical issues found

### 📊 **What It Finds**
- **SQL injection** vulnerabilities
- **Cross-site scripting** (XSS) issues
- **Buffer overflow** problems
- **Authentication bypass** weaknesses
- **Input validation** failures

---

## Code Scanning: Real Example

### 🚨 **Vulnerability Found**
```javascript
// ❌ UNSAFE CODE
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId;
```

### ✅ **Safe Alternative**
```javascript
// ✅ SAFE CODE
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?";
const params = [userId];
```

### 📋 **What Happens**
1. **CodeQL detects** the SQL injection pattern
2. **Alert is created** with severity HIGH
3. **PR is blocked** from merging
4. **Developer fixes** the issue
5. **New scan confirms** the fix

---

## Secret Scanning: Preventing Credential Leaks

### 🔑 **What It Detects**
- **API keys** and access tokens
- **Database passwords** and connection strings
- **Cloud credentials** (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **SSH private keys** and certificates
- **OAuth secrets** and client IDs

### 🚫 **Push Protection**
- **Blocks commits** containing secrets
- **Immediate feedback** to developers
- **Prevents accidental** credential exposure
- **Policy override** with business justification

---

## Secret Scanning: Real Example

### 🚨 **Accidental Secret Commit**
```bash
# Developer accidentally commits this:
echo "DATABASE_PASSWORD=super_secret_123" >> .env
git add .env
git commit -m "Add database configuration"
git push origin feature-branch
```

### 🛡️ **What Happens**
1. **Secret scanning** detects the password
2. **Push is blocked** with error message
3. **Developer removes** the secret
4. **New commit** without sensitive data
5. **Push succeeds** safely

---

## Dependency Management: Supply Chain Security

### 📦 **What Dependabot Monitors**
- **Direct dependencies** you explicitly install
- **Transitive dependencies** (dependencies of dependencies)
- **Known vulnerabilities** from security databases
- **License compliance** and legal requirements
- **Outdated packages** with security patches

### 🔄 **Automated Updates**
- **Security patches** applied automatically
- **Minor updates** for bug fixes
- **Major updates** with breaking changes
- **Dependency conflicts** resolved automatically

---

## Dependency Management: Real Example

### 🚨 **Vulnerable Dependency Found**
```
Package: lodash
Version: 4.17.15
Vulnerability: CVE-2021-23337
Severity: HIGH
Description: Prototype pollution vulnerability
```

### 🔧 **What Happens**
1. **Dependabot creates** a PR with the fix
2. **Automated tests** run on the new version
3. **Security team reviews** the change
4. **PR is merged** after approval
5. **Dependency is updated** automatically

---

## Security Alerts Dashboard

### 📊 **What You'll See**
- **Total alerts** by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Trends over time** (improving or getting worse)
- **Top repositories** with security issues
- **Dependency vulnerabilities** by type
- **Secret scanning** results and status

### 🎯 **How to Use It**
- **Daily check** for new critical issues
- **Weekly review** of medium/high issues
- **Monthly analysis** of security trends
- **Quarterly reporting** to stakeholders

---

## Security Policies & Enforcement

### 📋 **Policy Types**
- **Required reviewers** for security changes
- **Automated blocking** of critical vulnerabilities
- **Secret scanning** enforcement levels
- **Dependency update** requirements
- **License compliance** rules

### 🚦 **Enforcement Levels**
- **Block**: Changes cannot proceed
- **Warn**: Changes proceed with warnings
- **Allow**: No restrictions (not recommended)

---

## Security Team Workflow

### 🔍 **Daily Activities**
1. **Review new alerts** by severity
2. **Triage issues** by impact and exploitability
3. **Assign fixes** to appropriate teams
4. **Track remediation** progress
5. **Update stakeholders** on status

### 📈 **Weekly Activities**
1. **Analyze trends** in security findings
2. **Review policy** effectiveness
3. **Plan security initiatives** based on data
4. **Coordinate with** development teams
5. **Report to management** on security posture
