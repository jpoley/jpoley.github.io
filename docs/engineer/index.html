</section><section>
  <section> 
  <h3>get out of your comfort zone </h3>
    <p>experiment, and learn new things every day</p>
    <h3>embrace failure</h3>
   <p>  an experienced engineer has failed more times than a beginner has tried.</p>
<h3> Change your perspective</h3>
<p>from:  I have to learn new things<p>

<h3>Breaking Down a Problem Into Smaller Parts</h3>
<p style="font-size: 0.6em;">
Breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts is a critical problem-solving technique used across many disciplines. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of each component, making the problem less overwhelming. By addressing each part individually, you can create a clear path toward a solution. This method is especially useful in software development, engineering, and complex project management, where tackling smaller tasks often leads to more efficient and effective solutions.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Stepping Back / Step away</h3>
<p style="font-size: 0.6em;">
Stepping back or stepping away from a problem can be an effective strategy for gaining clarity. Giving yourself time to think allows your brain to process the information subconsciously, often leading to new insights or solutions. This practice can reduce mental fatigue and help you return to the problem with a fresh perspective, making it easier to approach challenges creatively and more effectively.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>The Importance of Learning One New Thing at a Time</h3>
<p style="font-size: 0.6em;">
Learning one new thing at a time, while connecting it to what you already know, is a key strategy to avoid being overwhelmed. This approach allows you to build on your existing knowledge, deepening your understanding without overloading your mind with too many new concepts at once. By focusing on incremental learning, you ensure better retention and application of new skills, leading to more sustainable progress over time.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Impostor Syndrome</h3>
<p style="font-size: 0.6em;">
To overcome impostor syndrome, remind yourself that everyone knows things others don't. You have unique skills and knowledge that others may not possess. Also, while you are aware of what you don't know, others often aren't, and that doesn't diminish your competence. Focus on continuous learning and recognize that feeling uncertain at times is a normal part of growth.
</p>
<h3>embracing what you don't know</h3>
<p>this is a chance to learn these things</p>

<h3>Local Environment</h3>
<p>the best skill any engineer can have is the ability to learn new skills</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Using WSL for Windows</h3>
<p style="font-size: 0.6em;">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows without the need for a virtual machine. It's lightweight and integrates seamlessly with Windows, making it a great option for developers who need Linux tools while still working in a Windows environment. WSL 2 brings improved performance with full Linux kernel support.</p>
<p style="font-size: 0.6em;"><a href="https://github.com/davidbombal/wsl2-windows10" target="_blank">Get started with WSL2 on GitHub</a></p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Using Vagrant with VirtualBox</h3>
<p style="font-size: 0.6em;">Vagrant, together with VirtualBox, enables the creation and management of lightweight, reproducible virtual environments.

<section>
<h3>Isolated Package Manager</h3>
<p style="font-size: 0.6em;">Using an isolated package manager, such as `pipenv` for Python, `npm` with `nvm` for Node.js, or `rbenv` for Ruby, ensures that each project has its own dependencies and versions, preventing conflicts. This isolation allows different projects to run independently without affecting each other's environment, leading to greater stability and easier debugging. Additionally, it makes it easier to replicate and share environments with other developers, especially in team settings or CI/CD pipelines.</p>

Key things to think about
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<h3> 1. Embrace Systems Thinking </h3>
<p>Think beyond individual components. Understand how different parts of the software interact, affect each other, and work as a whole. Focus on the big picture as well as the details.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<h3> 2. Focus on Problem Solving, Not Just Tools</h3>
<p>Being a good engineer isn't about knowing every tool. It's about breaking down problems into manageable parts, finding the root cause, and solving them systematically.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3> 3. Prioritize Communication and Collaboration</h3>
<p>Successful software development relies heavily on communication. Whether it's documenting code, participating in code reviews, or working with cross-functional teams, communication is key.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>4. Learn to Reason About Trade-Offs</h3>
<p>Every engineering decision has trade-offs. Balancing between speed, scalability, complexity, and technical debt is essential. There is rarely a perfect solution, so optimize for the best choice under the circumstances.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>5. Develop a Growth Mindset</h3>
<p>Always be willing to learn. New technologies, frameworks, and practices constantly emerge. Cultivate curiosity and the desire to improve continuously in both technical and soft skills.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3> 6. Understand the Value of Clean Code</h3>
<p>Clean, readable code is more valuable than clever, obscure code. It's easier to maintain, scale, and debug. Write with future maintainers in mind, including your future self.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3> 7. Approach Bugs Methodically</h3>
<p>Debugging is an inevitable part of the engineering process. Stay calm, break down the problem, and approach bugs systematically. Understand the root cause instead of applying quick fixes.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3> 8. Use Version Control Effectively</h3>
<p>Git and other version control systems are essential tools for collaboration. Learn how to create meaningful commits, branch properly, and handle conflicts gracefully. This ensures smoother team development.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>  9. Testing is Non-Negotiable</h3>
</p>Test early, test often. Well-written tests improve code quality, reliability, and confidence during deployments. Understand different testing levels: unit, integration, and end-to-end.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>  10. Adopt the "You Aren't Gonna Need It" (YAGNI) Principle</h3>
<p>Don't over-engineer by creating features or abstractions that might never be used. Focus on the immediate problem at hand and avoid unnecessary complexity.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>  11. Automation is Your Friend</h3>
<p>Manual processes are prone to error and take valuable time. Automate tasks like testing, deployment, and monitoring to ensure consistency and save time for critical work.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>  12. Understand the Concept of Technical Debt</h3>
<p>All code has a cost. Understand that shortcuts taken today can create technical debt, which will need to be paid later. Regularly review and refactor code to avoid accumulating too much debt.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>  13. Be Data-Driven in Decision Making</h3>
<p>Use metrics and data to inform decisions. Whether you're optimizing performance, identifying bottlenecks, or improving the user experience, objective data helps remove guesswork.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>  14. Respect the Power of Abstraction</h3>
Abstractions simplify complexity but come with trade-offs. They can be powerful tools for simplifying design but avoid layering too many abstractions as they can obscure the underlying logic.
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>  15. Optimize for Readability Over Optimization</h3>
Premature optimization is a common trap. Focus on writing readable, maintainable code first. Only optimize performance when there is a demonstrated need, backed by data.
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>  16. Embrace Feedback Loops</h3>
<p>Feedback loops help you iterate and improve your work. Whether from code reviews, users, or monitoring systems, timely feedback will help you adjust and evolve your engineering solutions.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>  17. Use Design Patterns Wisely</h3>
<p>Understand common design patterns but don't force them into every situation. They are tools in your toolkit but should be used when the problem fits the pattern.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>  18. Keep Security at the Forefront</h3>
<p>Security isn't an afterthought. Think about potential vulnerabilities early on and build secure systems by design. Regularly review code for potential weaknesses.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>  19. Think in Terms of Scalability and Resilience</h3>
<p>Build systems that can handle growth and recover gracefully from failures. This requires thinking about architecture, data flow, and fault tolerance from the start.</p>
</section>
<section>
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>  20. Know When to Ask for Help</h3>
<p>Engineering is a team sport. There's no shame in asking for help when you're stuck. Leverage the knowledge of your peers, mentors, and community to solve problems more efficiently.</p>

<h2>SOLID Software Principles Overview</h2>
<p>
The SOLID principles are a set of five design guidelines that help software engineers create maintainable, flexible, and scalable code. Each principle focuses on a different aspect of software architecture, promoting clean and robust designs.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h2>
<p>
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. This principle emphasizes that each class should focus on a single part of the functionality provided by the software and should encapsulate it entirely.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h2>
<p>
Software entities such as classes, modules, and functions should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without altering existing code, which helps prevent bugs and maintains stability.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h2>
<p>
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that derived classes extend base classes without changing their behavior, supporting the use of inheritance.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h2>
<p>
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle suggests splitting larger interfaces into smaller, more specific ones so that clients only need to be aware of the methods that are relevant to them, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h2>
<p>
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, and abstractions should not depend on details. This principle encourages the use of interfaces or abstract classes to reduce the dependency on concrete implementations.
