# Jason Poley's Website

This repository contains my personal website built with Hugo and the reveal-hugo theme for presentations.

## Project Structure

```
├── content/                  # Source content files (Markdown)
│   ├── _index.md             # Home page content -> Published to '/'
│   ├── engineerING/  # Engineering presentation -> Published to '/engineering/'
│   └── ai/
│       └── worlds-fair/     # AI World's Fair presentation -> Published to '/ai/worlds-fair/'
├── themes/                   # Hugo themes
│   └── reveal-hugo/          # Theme for presentations
├── public/                   # Temporary build output (generated by Hugo)
└── .github/
    └── workflows/            # GitHub Actions workflows
```

Each content folder directly maps to a URL path in the published site. For example:
- Content in `/content/engineer-presentation/_index.md` is published to `/engineer-presentation/`
- Content in `/content/ai/worlds-fair/_index.md` is published to `/ai/worlds-fair/`

The reveal-hugo theme requires section content to be in `_index.md` files, not `index.md`.

## Development

To run the site locally:

```bash
hugo server -D
```

This will start a development server at http://localhost:1313/ with live reload.

## Content Management

All content is stored in Markdown files in the `/content` directory:

- Create or edit presentations in their respective folders
- Add `+++` or `---` frontmatter for Hugo configuration
- Use the `outputs = ["Reveal"]` parameter for presentations

## Deployment

The site is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the master branch.

The GitHub Actions workflow:
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up Hugo
3. Builds the site
4. Deploys to the `gh-pages` branch

### GitHub Pages Configuration

To make this deployment work, configure GitHub Pages as follows:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" > "Pages"
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select the "gh-pages" branch and "/" (root) folder
5. Click "Save"

This ensures that GitHub serves your site from the gh-pages branch, which is automatically updated by the GitHub Actions workflow whenever you push changes to the master branch.
