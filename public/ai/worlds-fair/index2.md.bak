  - Traction across vendors
  - Critical to agent orchestration moving forwarddditional Key Lessons from AI Engineer World’s Fair SF 2025

## 1. Deep Dive on MCP and Its Spec
- **MCP has matured into a full-blown standard protocol**, with enhancements like streamable HTTP (HTTP POST + SSE), authentication layers, discovery mechanisms, and elicitation flows—enabling truly dynamic agent‑to‑agent communication :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
- Its spec now features **vertical server patterns** (e.g., domain‑specific MCP servers) and best practices from Anthropic and community contributors :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
- **Engineering reasoning**: Given its centrality (dedicated MCP track, multiple deep-dive talks) and traction across vendors, we spotlighted this as critical to agent orchestration moving forward.

## 2. Security Must Be a First‑Class Citizen
- **Security frameworks** (e.g., “MCP Guardian”) are becoming vital—a defense‑in‑depth approach adding authentication, rate-limiting, audit logs, WAF scanning, etc., to protect agent-tool chains :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
- Broader “security‑by‑design” practices were highlighted during the Security track, advocating **continuous risk assessment, hardening, anomaly detection, and comprehensive logging** at every system layer :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
- **Reasoning**: Security’s inclusion as a main conference track and multiple academic papers confirm both its urgency and that existing guardrails remain nascent.

## 3. Evals Remain the Hardest and Most Indispensable
- The Evals track underscored that though **eval is universally recognized as mission-critical**, manual creation remains a bottleneck—and building automated, semantic/trajectory-based eval pipelines is still next-gen work :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.
- Teams like Braintrust and Zapier are already using **AI-driven scorers**, and deploying both explicit and implicit feedback pipelines to better assess performance in production :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.
- **Engineering reasoning**: With “Evals” as a named core track and echoed in recaps (e.g. "Eval is all you need"), this is clearly a fundamental challenge waiting for robust tooling and standards.

## 4. Specs-as-Code: Specifications Are The New Code
- Adoption of **Specification‑Driven Development**, especially around *ModelSpecs*, was featured: specs written in markdown (e.g., rules.md) become executable contracts, more durable than ephemeral prompts :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.
- Sean Grove’s presentation emphasized that structured specs embed intent, requirements, and verifiable tests—laying a stronger foundation for LLM reliability and reproducibility :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.
- **Why included**: This wasn’t covered in the original 7-market learnings but was a major highlight in the SWE‑Agents/SPEC track—transformative for long-term maintainability.

## 5. Security-By-Design Overhaul for Autonomous Models
- A freshly introduced paradigm from the Security track: **Risk‑aware, security‑by‑design pipelines** for large-scale autonomous models—covering everything from design-time threat modeling to runtime anomaly detection and hardened training :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.
- Case studies from national-security and industrial deployments reinforce the tangible need for "provable behavior guarantees" in live AI systems :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.
- **Rationale**: Signals a leap forward—moving beyond point security fixes toward full lifecycle governance in real-world, autonomous AI.
